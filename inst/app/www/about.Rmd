<i>tenzing</i> is a project of the [contributorship collaboration](https://tenzing-contrib.github.io/).

_tenzing_ is named after the Nepali-Indian Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, who was one of the first two people to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Despite his essential contribution, the achievement is often credited less to him than to his partner, the New Zealand mountaineer Edmund Hillary.
